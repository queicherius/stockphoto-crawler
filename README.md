# Stockphoto Crawler

[![No Maintenance Intended](https://img.shields.io/badge/No%20Maintenance%20Intended-%E2%9C%95-red.svg?style=flat-square)](http://unmaintained.tech/)

Crawler for free stockphotos, inspired by the post ["Stockphotos that don't suck" on Medium](https://medium.com/p/62ae4bcbe01b).

This downloads around 2300+ images (8,6GB+).

**Note:** This script relies on the page structure to remain the same. As soon
as the crawled pages change their structure, the script will stop working.
